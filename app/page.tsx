                    Hey! My name is Alex. I'm a self-taught programmer and a
                    freelance worker from Greece, specializing in frontend
                    development and design. Programming is a big passion for me,
                    and I have been programming for many years now.

                    The first lines of code I ever wrote were for a simple
                    Discord bot using Python in 2018. This led to making
                    Minecraft mods and clients during 2020 for fun with my
                    friends, which really helped me understand how code works.

                    I started making websites in 2021 and haven't stopped
                    working on creating new websites and notable experiences for
                    others since. The first website I created consisted only of
                    simple JavaScript and social links. Then I moved on to
                    trying web frameworks such as Vue, React, Svelte, and more.
