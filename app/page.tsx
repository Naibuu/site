                    My name is Alex. I'm a self-taught programmer and freelance
                    worker from Greece, specializing in frontend development and
                    design. Programming is a huge passion of mine, and I have
                    been hooked for multiple years now.

                    The first lines of code I ever wrote were for a simple
                    Discord bot I made using Python. This experience led me to
                    create other silly projects, like Minecraft mods and
                    clients, which really helped me understand how code works.

                    In 2021, I began making websites and haven't stopped since.
                    I've created multiple websites and notable experiences for
                    everyone. I am experienced with many important web
                    frameworks, such as Vue, React, Svelte, and more.
